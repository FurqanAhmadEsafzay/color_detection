## Project Overview

Color detection is a common computer vision task with applications in robotics, human-computer interaction, industrial inspection, and more. In this project:

- A webcam captures real-time video frames.
- Frames are converted to the HSV color space.
- A color mask is applied to detect specific colors.
- Contours of the detected color regions are extracted.
- Bounding boxes are drawn around the detected objects.


##  Technologies Used

-  Python 3.12
-  OpenCV (`cv2`) with GUI Support
-  Pillow
-  Webcam for real-time input
-  NumPy
-  Environment Color Detection
